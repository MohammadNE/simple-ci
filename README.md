# CI Templates

This repository is a good source of CI templates added and modified by users as a best practice. In this project we aimed to demonstrate how to use different CI/CD tools for various languages and frameworks.

Let's grow together - DevOps Hobbies team.

## Goal

In this repository, we are trying to gather some practical samples of the `CI` files for each language and framework, so you can use them in your projects.
We are trying to provide CI templates as best practices.

## Usage

The base project exists on each directory (without CI tools configured) and the content of `github`, `gitlab` and `jenkins` are available in a seperate directories.

In order to use these CI tools, you have to paste them into your exsisting project.

## Categories based on the `Languages` and `Frameworks`
